laugh at said you had a mood and the


result is irresistible they're actually


pretty popular these days you got a


faithful friend Labradoodle Jennifer


Aniston has one Vice President Biden has


one and Tiger Woods has two labradoodles


were created in Australia in the late


1980s by a retired veterinarian he knew


somebody who needed a guide dog who


happened to be allergic to dogs so he


mixed a gentle and intelligent dog a


Labrador Retriever with another


intelligent and low shedding dog a


poodle to create a service dog that


would be a good choice for someone that


maybe does have allergies but they're


not hypoallergenic no dog is in fact


labradoodles are simply a better choice


for allergy sufferers because they often


secrete less dander than other breeds


today this designer dog is on the verge


of becoming a breed of its own here's


the reason why when labradoodles are


bred with other labradoodles their


litters can retain the main


characteristics associated with this


easy to love pooch first their heads


tend to be broad and their eyebrows are


usually well-defined their coats come in


every color but their hair style well


that's still a bit of a mystery because


of the labradoodles cross you never know


what kind of coat you're gonna get there


are three basic code types there's hair


which is straighter


which is wavy and wool which is the


curliest and the most allergy friendly


labradoodles are versatile in that they


can live in small or large spaces but if


their apartment dwellers a daily walk


around the block just isn't going to cut


it these guys need outlet in the


exercise for your things to work on and


they can have some inherited health


problems hip dysplasia being the biggest


and also they can develop some genetic I


problems as well but in the grooming


Department this adorable pooch that


hardly sheds is pretty low-maintenance


just a little brushing a little bathing


and the dog is gonna be happy


intelligent and eager to please


labradoodles are easy to train just make


sure you start early good sit it's a dog


that has a lot of energy and needs a lot


of help focusing that energy in the


right direction and whether or not you


or a loved one has allergies


labradoodles make a great addition to


the family because they're docile and


social


to sum up labradoodles can live in most


environments as long as they get a lot


of exercise they can suffer from hip


dysplasia and some genetic eye problems


but they're easy to groom easy to train


and make excellent family pets it's no


wonder the Labradoodle is such a popular


designer dog darling and devoted these
