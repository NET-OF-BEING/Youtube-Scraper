Best Breed Ever!

Labradoodle!

Labradoodles are a mix between Labrador retriever
and standard Poodle.

Labradoodles were first bred to create a hypoallergenic
guide dog.

Wally Conron created the breed in Australia
in the 1980s.

He later regretted sparking the designer dog
fad.

Labradoodles are now in the Oxford Dictionary,
but not in the American Kennel Club list of

official breeds.

Labradoodles replaced the Scottish terrier
in Monopoly for the "Here and Now" version.

Labradoodles' hair comes in either wavy, fleece,
or curly.

They donâ€™t shed as much as other dogs.

Labradoodles are friendly and good with families
and kids.

Labradoodles can live in small apartment,
but need a lot of exercise.

Labradoodles live to around 12 years old.
