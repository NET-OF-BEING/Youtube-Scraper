"Of all the things I miss from veterinary
practice, puppy breath is one of the most

fond memories!"

- Dr. Tom Cat

Labradoodles are becoming increasingly popular
as family pets due to their affectionate personality

and the fact that Labradoodles quickly become
a child’s best friend.

Labradoodles are considered as the pioneers
of the hybrid breeds.

Whether you already proudly own a Labradoodle
or you are considering welcoming one into

your family soon, we hope you will find the
following fun facts about Labradoodles interesting.

Welcome to Animal Facts, I'm Leroy.

Let's Get Started.

10.

As implied by the name, Labradoodles are a
cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Standard

Poodle.

The labradoodle entered the limelight in 1988,
when an Australian breeder successfully crossed

the breeds to create guide dogs for the Royal
Guide Dogs Association of Australia that might

also be attractive to those allergic to fur
and dander.

Introduced to American breeders soon afterward,
the breed gained skyrocketing popularity because

of its calm demeanor and hypoallergenic nature.

Blessed with the outstanding qualities found
firmly ingrained in the genes of their parent

breeds, labradoodles are naturally intuitive,
social, loving and easily trained.

They crave stimulation, require companionship
and have proven themselves to be great dogs

for families, especially those with young
children.

Labradoodles have made quite an impression
on popular culture, even making it into the

Oxford English Dictionary – creating a new
winning word placement for Scrabble gamers.

The creators of the famous board game Monopoly
have also hopped on the bandwagon, replacing

the Scottish terrier icon with a labradoodle
on their “Here and Now” game version.

7.

In the charity arena, Lucky the labradoodle,
a stuffed plush toy made by Lord &amp; Taylor,

has been utilized to raise money for the American
Cancer Society and other notable causes.

6.

Poodles have a reputation for being hypoallergenic,
meaning that they can supposedly be tolerated

by people who have allergies to dogs.

Because they have the Poodle in their heritage,
Labradoodles are sometimes promoted as being

hypoallergenic.

But allergies are not caused by a particular
dog coat type but by dander, the dead skin

cells that are shed by all dogs (and people).

Some people with mild allergies react less
severely to particular dogs, but no dog can

be guarenteed hypoallergenic.

5.

Like Poodles, Labradoodles can vary in size
depending on the dominant genes inherited

from their parents and ancestors.

The three distinctive sizes are miniature,
medium and standard.

Miniature Labradoodles are 14 to 16 inches
in height and can weigh up to 25 pounds.

Medium sized Labradoodles can grow anywhere
between 17 and 21 inches and weigh up to 45

pounds.

The standard size Labradoodle can weigh more
than 45 pounds as an adult and stand at least

22 inches tall.

4.

Labradoodles are becoming so popular even
celebrities are welcoming them into their

family.

Celebrity owners include Jennifer Aniston,
Christie Brinkley, Tiger Woods, Hugh Panaro,

and Joe Biden.

3.

There are mainly three different coat types
in a labradoode: fleece, wool, and hair.

The fleece coat is usually wavy and long and
has a silky feel to it.

The wool coat is similar to that of a sheep's
or poodle's, and has tight curls and feels

like a wool sweater.

The hair coat is straight or slightly wavy
and has a wispy look to it.

This type of coat is not as allergy friendly,
but most people with allergies will be able

to tolerate it.

Labradoodles come in almost any coat color,
ranging from Red, Black, Silver, Blue, Caramel,

Chocolate, Cafe, Lavender, Cream, Apricot,
and white.

The labradoodle can also have what is called
"parti" which is when it is a combination

of two different colors like an apricot body
and then white patches mainly on the feet

and chest.

2.

Labradoodles are not a considered an official
dog breed by most dog expert organizations,

although the American Kennel Club has now
created the 'Canine Partners"category to include

the Labradoodle and other hybrid breeds for
agility and other competitions.

1.

Both Labradors and Poodles are long-living
breeds, so a 15-year-old Labradoodle is not

unusual; average lifespan is 12+ years.

Well, there ya have it, a mixed list about
the pioneers of the hybrid breeds.
