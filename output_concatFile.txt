what's up you guys welcome to the video


i am here with my brother and I'm


actually doing something that I am


really I'm excited I'm super super


excited but I am also incredibly


incredibly nervous so what I'm doing


we're actually at crossfit rsd which is


actually John's CrossFit gym that he's


been going to for a month now and since


he started going it's been something


that I've been wanting to do so I'm


really excited today is giving my first


ever CrossFit workout that I've ever


done in my entire life so I'm really


excited to get into it John could you


kind of explain what CrossFit is being


taken camera to me now so for everyone


who's wondering what CrossFit is


basically it's a type of workout that


focuses on high intensity it focuses on


functional movements and then it focuses


on constant variance so you're not going


in on mondays to work chest and you're


not going in on Tuesdays to work back


and buy what you're doing is there's a


wad the workout of the day it's posted


in the morning and that's what you're


doing is focusing on different body


parts and how they can functionally help


you in your everyday life whether it's


picking up a box so there's picking up a


pin off the ground that's a deadlift


it's a really light deadlift but it's a


deadlift so it's it's a type of workout


the focus is on high intensity but also


functional movements so it's pretty


awesome is that was a really good


explanation it's like you practiced that


so yeah we're really excited basically


everything he said I just realized this


on that word right there but yeah I'm


really really excited this I've never


done anything like this and I'm just


really excited to take fitness to


another level just do something


different so I'm excited to bring you


this with you guys so today is my first


crossfit workouts also I got a new lens


it's a wide angle in so you can see a


lot more when I'm holding my camera so


hopefully you guys like that and then


you can kind of zoom in and stuff so I


hope you guys like that let's get into


this workout I changed my shirt and I


really like it but John is going to


explain the workout that we're going to


be doing today or the WOD essentially


for we divided up in the strength and


then


conditioning so our strength movement is


going to be a sumo deadlift and you want


to get your three rep max yes you have


ten minutes to find that so you put on


ten pounds spent on 10 pounds 9 25


pounds whatever it is we want to get 23


reps bless your match that's strength


and then you can take a small break and


then we're going to have our metcon


which is metabolic conditioning that's


like the conditioning part of it that's


going to be three rounds of 60 double


unders which is a jump rope 20 calories


on a rower and then 15 deadlifts this


prescription rx is what's called is 225


pounds but you can scale that you can


scale the double unders into singles and


then you can scale the calorie row which


you probably actually shouldn't need to


do that but the idea is that you can


always RX is what the prescribed workout


is and then you can always go under with


doing singles instead of double unders


on the jump rope by doing less weight or


you can do our X plus if you feel like


you want to get more you can add more


weight we start off with a runner right


like a warm-up so a warm-up is going to


be forward for me to run which is a


quarter mile and then we just do a


couple stretches just to be nimble and


warm and then we start to work out so


let's do it we are starting so 400-meter


run to start right mr. it's about a


quarter mile yep we're gonna be running


out here up the hill up the hill oh gosh


all right let's do this


now surprisingly wasn't that bad for


some reason I thought that was gonna be


a lot longer so now we are doing 25


jumping jacks 25 miles


alright warm-up is done now we start the


wat now we're going to work up to our


three rep max on sumo deadlift I'm kind


of excited about this because this is my


deadlift a choice so hopefully I'm able


to work up to something slightly heavy


305 now graduate by pounds


my my


Oh


so for my top set I got 305 pounds and


John got through in 25 pounds Jim huh on


to the Met met Sean metcon onto the Met


condo now we are doing the metcon so


we're going to be doing 60 double unders


but since I've never done double unders


he said I could do 180 singles which is


with this jump rope right here so I'm


gonna do 180 jump rope and then we are


going to be doing 20 calories on the row


machine which is over there so just row


and tell you hit 20 calories and then 15


deadlifts with 225 pounds we're gonna be


doing that three times so let's see how


it goes


jump rope is done now we're going to do


20 calories on this row right here


bring that up to the bottom of you


go now we're moving on to 15 dead list


with 225 pound and that'll be into


around one then we have two more rounds


after that


Oh


round one done no don't have to do that


two more times


24 minutes and he's on the floor


25 minutes


that was so hard


but it was a lot of fun


I'll talk to you when I can actually


speak thank you so much when dissociate


it same as dude hi guys any time so it's


been a few hours and i'm home now


obviously showered up and everything and


I just kind of wanted to give my last


impressions on crossfit and on my


workout today the first thing I want to


say is that it was so much fun like I


can see the allure and why people like


doing it so much because I've never done


a group workout setting like that I've


never done like classes or anything like


that so it was really cool and very


different instead of just you know going


into the gym and putting in my


headphones and you know cutting


everything else out and not focusing on


anybody else it was like the music was


playing we were all working out together


doing the same exact workout and that


was just really really cool that like


camaraderie to be like yo we're


suffering together we're all doing this


together I really see why so many people


really really enjoy CrossFit another


thing I want to say this is completely


random but an actual like youtuber that


I've been following that is just he just


putting out amazing content he's


actually originally a really really nice


guy I would love you guys to check him


out but he's just really helped me kind


of understand a little bit more his that


his youtube name is team Richie and he's


just a really nice dude and he's putting


out really great video so I just wanted


to cut him out and just let you guys


know that he's if you guys are


interested in CrossFit or just


interested in more you know fitness


vlogs CrossFit vlogs he does an amazing


job great quality I'm gonna link him


down below just awesome guy and I would


love for you guys to check them out and


then you know comment that you're from


John's channel just so he knows who sent


him but you guys like that's why I can


see why CrossFit is so like so many


people gravitate towards it because it's


that camaraderie it's like you're on a


team almost but you're not really on a


team so it was it was really fun and it


was hard like that was not easy that


workout was tough the only thing that


the issue that I have and this is the


issue that I feel like I'm a lot of


people have it's just like form break


down and then injuring yourself like


it's really hard because I think it's up


to the purse it's each individual person


like it's your decision if you want to


go heavier it's your decision if you


want to lower the weight so if you're


not really in tune with your body and


knowing how the form is supposed to feel


and you know if you've never done sumo


deadlifts you don't know how the form is


supposed to be and things like that so I


can


see why so many people don't like it and


like have that bad image of it but I


really think that if you go into it and


you understand like if you look at the


work out the day before and you like


look up look up all the workouts and you


know you really try and focus on form


focus on what your form is like when


you're working out and things like that


I really think it can be safe but you


know I do understand why so many people


are have that negative you know thought


about it but I think for me personally


the positives really outweigh the


negatives it was it was just really fun


going into the gym working out for a


24-point I think I did 24 minutes and


five seconds and I had one of the most


amazing workouts that I've ever had so


it was really really fun I plan on you


know continuing doing crossfit not sure


how much it might be once a week it


might be three times a week I don't


really know yet but it was really fun


and I really enjoyed enjoyed it and I


also i want to ask you guys a question


so if i do continue to in crossfit i was


thinking about maybe making a series


here on this channel that would live


here i was thinking about naming it


something like the crossfit chronicles


and just kind of chronicling my journey


in a CrossFit and just so you guys can


have something else to watch that's


gonna be this video thank you guys so


much for watching make sure you like


comment and subscribe there was one


other thing that I wanted to say oh yeah


look up of him all day the warning signs


and when there are flashing lights or


wig legs don't attempt to cross until


the coming to a complete stop
