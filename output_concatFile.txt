laugh at said you had a mood and the


result is irresistible they're actually


pretty popular these days you got a


faithful friend Labradoodle Jennifer


Aniston has one Vice President Biden has


one and Tiger Woods has two labradoodles


were created in Australia in the late


1980s by a retired veterinarian he knew


somebody who needed a guide dog who


happened to be allergic to dogs so he


mixed a gentle and intelligent dog a


Labrador Retriever with another


intelligent and low shedding dog a


poodle to create a service dog that


would be a good choice for someone that


maybe does have allergies but they're


not hypoallergenic no dog is in fact


labradoodles are simply a better choice


for allergy sufferers because they often


secrete less dander than other breeds


today this designer dog is on the verge


of becoming a breed of its own here's


the reason why when labradoodles are


bred with other labradoodles their


litters can retain the main


characteristics associated with this


easy to love pooch first their heads


tend to be broad and their eyebrows are


usually well-defined their coats come in


every color but their hair style well


that's still a bit of a mystery because


of the labradoodles cross you never know


what kind of coat you're gonna get there


are three basic code types there's hair


which is straighter


which is wavy and wool which is the


curliest and the most allergy friendly


labradoodles are versatile in that they


can live in small or large spaces but if


their apartment dwellers a daily walk


around the block just isn't going to cut


it these guys need outlet in the


exercise for your things to work on and


they can have some inherited health


problems hip dysplasia being the biggest


and also they can develop some genetic I


problems as well but in the grooming


Department this adorable pooch that


hardly sheds is pretty low-maintenance


just a little brushing a little bathing


and the dog is gonna be happy


intelligent and eager to please


labradoodles are easy to train just make


sure you start early good sit it's a dog


that has a lot of energy and needs a lot


of help focusing that energy in the


right direction and whether or not you


or a loved one has allergies


labradoodles make a great addition to


the family because they're docile and


social


to sum up labradoodles can live in most


environments as long as they get a lot


of exercise they can suffer from hip


dysplasia and some genetic eye problems


but they're easy to groom easy to train


and make excellent family pets it's no


wonder the Labradoodle is such a popular


designer dog darling and devoted these


practically perfect pets get their

"Of all the things I miss from veterinary
practice, puppy breath is one of the most

fond memories!"

- Dr. Tom Cat

Labradoodles are becoming increasingly popular
as family pets due to their affectionate personality

and the fact that Labradoodles quickly become
a childs best friend.

Labradoodles are considered as the pioneers
of the hybrid breeds.

Whether you already proudly own a Labradoodle
or you are considering welcoming one into

your family soon, we hope you will find the
following fun facts about Labradoodles interesting.

Welcome to Animal Facts, I'm Leroy.

Let's Get Started.

10.

As implied by the name, Labradoodles are a
cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Standard

Poodle.

The labradoodle entered the limelight in 1988,
when an Australian breeder successfully crossed

the breeds to create guide dogs for the Royal
Guide Dogs Association of Australia that might

also be attractive to those allergic to fur
and dander.

Introduced to American breeders soon afterward,
the breed gained skyrocketing popularity because

of its calm demeanor and hypoallergenic nature.

9.

Blessed with the outstanding qualities found
firmly ingrained in the genes of their parent

breeds, labradoodles are naturally intuitive,
social, loving and easily trained.

They crave stimulation, require companionship
and have proven themselves to be great dogs

for families, especially those with young
children.

8.

Labradoodles have made quite an impression
on popular culture, even making it into the

Oxford English Dictionary  creating a new
winning word placement for Scrabble gamers.

The creators of the famous board game Monopoly
have also hopped on the bandwagon, replacing

the Scottish terrier icon with a labradoodle
on their Here and Now game version.

7.

In the charity arena, Lucky the labradoodle,
a stuffed plush toy made by Lord &amp; Taylor,

has been utilized to raise money for the American
Cancer Society and other notable causes.

6.

Poodles have a reputation for being hypoallergenic,
meaning that they can supposedly be tolerated

by people who have allergies to dogs.

Because they have the Poodle in their heritage,
Labradoodles are sometimes promoted as being

hypoallergenic.

But allergies are not caused by a particular
dog coat type but by dander, the dead skin

cells that are shed by all dogs (and people).

Some people with mild allergies react less
severely to particular dogs, but no dog can

be guarenteed hypoallergenic.

5.

Like Poodles, Labradoodles can vary in size
depending on the dominant genes inherited

from their parents and ancestors.

The three distinctive sizes are miniature,
medium and standard.

Miniature Labradoodles are 14 to 16 inches
in height and can weigh up to 25 pounds.

Medium sized Labradoodles can grow anywhere
between 17 and 21 inches and weigh up to 45

pounds.

The standard size Labradoodle can weigh more
than 45 pounds as an adult and stand at least

22 inches tall.

4.

Labradoodles are becoming so popular even
celebrities are welcoming them into their

family.

Celebrity owners include Jennifer Aniston,
Christie Brinkley, Tiger Woods, Hugh Panaro,

and Joe Biden.

3.

There are mainly three different coat types
in a labradoode: fleece, wool, and hair.

The fleece coat is usually wavy and long and
has a silky feel to it.

The wool coat is similar to that of a sheep's
or poodle's, and has tight curls and feels

like a wool sweater.

The hair coat is straight or slightly wavy
and has a wispy look to it.

This type of coat is not as allergy friendly,
but most people with allergies will be able

to tolerate it.

Labradoodles come in almost any coat color,
ranging from Red, Black, Silver, Blue, Caramel,

Chocolate, Cafe, Lavender, Cream, Apricot,
and white.

The labradoodle can also have what is called
"parti" which is when it is a combination

of two different colors like an apricot body
and then white patches mainly on the feet

and chest.

2.

Labradoodles are not a considered an official
dog breed by most dog expert organizations,

although the American Kennel Club has now
created the 'Canine Partners"category to include

the Labradoodle and other hybrid breeds for
agility and other competitions.

1.

Both Labradors and Poodles are long-living
breeds, so a 15-year-old Labradoodle is not

unusual; average lifespan is 12+ years.

Well, there ya have it, a mixed list about
the pioneers of the hybrid breeds.

Best Breed Ever!

Labradoodle!

Labradoodles are a mix between Labrador retriever
and standard Poodle.

Labradoodles were first bred to create a hypoallergenic
guide dog.

Wally Conron created the breed in Australia
in the 1980s.

He later regretted sparking the designer dog
fad.

Labradoodles are now in the Oxford Dictionary,
but not in the American Kennel Club list of

official breeds.

Labradoodles replaced the Scottish terrier
in Monopoly for the "Here and Now" version.

Labradoodles' hair comes in either wavy, fleece,
or curly.

They dont shed as much as other dogs.

Labradoodles are friendly and good with families
and kids.

Labradoodles can live in small apartment,
but need a lot of exercise.

Labradoodles live to around 12 years old.
